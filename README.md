# angular-lumen-ddd-webapp
A project for quick starting an web APP using Angular 2 and a REST API made with Lumen, using DDD and TDD (BDD?) and build/qa tools for continuous integration.

# Work to do

This is a work in progress. The next steps are:
 
 - [Install](#install)
  
 - start a PHP Storm Project using predefined code style settings for PHP auto formatting and several validations. 
 including PHPCS for PSR-2 and PHPMD with many pre-defined rules for clean code. PHP build tools are checked out from this project which uses Docker images with all the tools used. 
  

- start a Lumen Project project with a DDD scruture (@davi)

- define rules, standards, build tools and more for JS (node, gulp, eslint, less/sass, bower, etc), plus the PHP Storm configs for integrations 

- start an Angular app project (find or create a DDD schema for angular?) and scaffold a sample page

- all the rest ... 

# Install

- make an install.sh that checks and install all main dependencies for the project (like Docker, Ant (for PHP build), node)
